# Coach Finder App
## Store management:
There are different ways for store management. We can write a single store file and access the state globally. In this case, data duplication may occur, and no one has a clue about which component updates the state in real-world large projects. To counter this problem, we use mutations for state updates in such a way that only mutations can update the state. For real-world projects, writing the store module in a single file is not an elegant way, as we are rushing; therefore, we create modules for each feature of our app. For example, in this project, we created 'Coaches' and 'Requests' modules and managed their states individually.
