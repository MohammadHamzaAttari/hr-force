### Store management:
In this repository, another way of state management is implemented. We manage the state in a simple way in first step, 
then we implemented with modules and use the helper mapper to reduce the code. In this repository, we study the 
importance of javascript basic funcions (like find, reduce, filter) importance in building the high performance web 
applications. We cover only client side logic and administrative part of the project might be implemented in another
repository.
